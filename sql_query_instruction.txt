# Use WHERE clause to query basic customer information
SELECT *

# Use ORDER to sort the data
SELECT *

ORDER BY Age ASC;

# Use LIMIT to select certain pool of candidates
SELECT *
FROM Customer_Data
WHERE Age > 20
ORDER BY Age DESC
LIMIT 3;

# USE COUNT(), SUM(), AVG() to calculate
SELECT COUNT(Name)
FROM Customer_Data

SELECT AVG(Age)
FROM Customer_Data;

SELECT SUM(Expense)

# Use IN syntax
SELECT Project_Name

# Table interactions

# Use INNER JOIN to find all customers' expense history
